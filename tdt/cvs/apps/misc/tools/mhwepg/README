INTRODUCTION

mhwepg is a program to extract proprietary EPG Data sent by the Canal+ group (Mediahighway receivers)
and parse it into a VDR compatible format.
It can be used to get a 7-days EPG for Canal Satellite France, Cyfra+,
Canal Satellite Digitaal, and Sky Italia (Please let me know
if you find other sources, such as cable TV).

You can use mhwepg to add EPG data to the VDR epg.data file. You can also transform
the file into HTML with the epg2html.pl script shipped with VDR.

REQUIREMENTS

You need a DVB card supported by the Linux DVB driver (http://www.linuxtv.org)
and the current DVB driver (API 3).

INSTALLATION

To compile the file :

make

USAGE

With VDR, (n)tuxzap, szap or dvbtune, tune to the frequency of the EPG
you want to retrieve :

Canal+/CanalSatellite France : Astra 19.2E / 12363 V / 27500
Canal Digitaal               : Astra 19.2E / 12515 H / 22000
Sky Italia                   : Hot Bird 13E / 11881 V / 27500
Cyfra+                       : Hot Bird 13E / 10719 V / 27500

You'll find in the archive a channels.conf file that
contains the parameters for these four channels.

Since some channels are broadcast on several transponders, you can use mhwepg to get EPG data for them, even if you are not receiving them in a MediaHighWay bouquet.
That's why you can define equivalences between two channels IDs, simply add a list of the channels in a file with the following format :
<MediaHighWay_channel_id> <other_channel_id> <comments>

For example, if you are receiving RTL 9 on Hot Bird, you can extract the 7 day EPG data for this channel send on Astra and apply it to the HorBird version of the channel.
The entry in the equivalence file would look like this:
S19.2E-1-1080-8805 S13E-318-15900-200 RTL9

You'll find other examples in the archive.
Note : Only the file for CanalSatellite France is actively maintained, others
are probably obsolete. Please send me updated files if you have them.

Note that the VDR channels.conf file must contain correct SID, NID and TID parameters.

The program can take several arguments, all optional :
   -a <adapter number>  : Number of the DVB adapter (default : 0)
   -d <demux number>    : Number of the DVB demux (default : 0)
   -s <source>          : Name of the source, as defined by the "sources.conf' file of VDR.
                          If no source is specified, only the SID will be written to the output file.
   -e <file>            : Name of the file containing the channels equivalences.
   -t number            : local time offset (in seconds)\n"
   -o <output file>     : Output file (default: stdout)
   -l                   : Send the channels list to stderr
   -h	                : Help

Exemple for Canal Satellite France :
./mhwepg -s S19.2E -e equiv.csn -o /video/epg.data

To convert the epg.data file to HTML :
epg2html <epg.data

You may also use SVDRP to put the new epg data into the VDR epg.data file.

TODO

I have found a new stream carrying EPG data (PID = 221). At this time, I have not understood its structure.
